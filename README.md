I tried to calculate these: 
-- calculate the math score average, number of each gender, just if the student got more than 70 degree
-- is the parental level of education affect the student's performance?
-- tring it with test preparation course
-- calculate the avg of final score for eatch student
-- calculate which group has the best performance in each score, by calculating the max average 
-- create a message for student who pass and doesn't based on their preparation course
